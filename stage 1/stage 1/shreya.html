Photography is the science, art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor,
  or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real
 image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical
 charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing.
 The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either
  negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is
  traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by
  contact printing.<br>

      Street photography, also sometimes called candid photography, is photography conducted for art or enquiry that features unmediated chance encounters and random incidents[1] within public places.
      Although there is a difference between street and candid photography it is usually subtle with most street photography being candid in nature
      but not all candid photography being classifiable as street photography. Street photography does not necessitate the presence of a street or even the urban environment.
      Though people usually feature directly, street photography might be absent of people and can be of an object or environment where the image projects a decidedly human character in facsimile or aesthetic.
  "The photographer is an armed version of the solitary walker reconnoitering, stalking, cruising the urban inferno, the voyeuristic stroller who discovers the city as a landscape of voluptuous extremes. Adept of the joys of watching, connoisseur of empathy, the flâneur finds the world "picturesque.""
   The street photographer can be seen as an extension of the flaneur, an observer of the streets (who was often a writer or artist).[4]
  Framing and timing can be key aspects of the craft with the aim of some street photography being to create images at a decisive or poignant moment.

        Aerial photography is the taking of photographs of the ground from an
        elevated/direct-down position. Usually the camera is not supported by a ground-based structure.
Aerial photography is the taking of photographs of the ground from an elevated/direct-down position. Usually the camera is not supported by a ground-based structure. Platforms for aerial photography include fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or "drones"), balloons, blimps and dirigibles, rockets, pigeons, kites, parachutes, stand-alone telescoping and vehicle-mounted poles
Mounted cameras may be triggered remotely or automatically; hand-held photographs may be taken by a photographer.Aerial photography should not be confused with air-to-air photography, where one or more aircraft are used as chase planes that "chase" and photograph other aircraft in flight.
Aerial photography was first practiced by the French photographer and balloonist Gaspard-Félix Tournachon, known as "Nadar", in 1858 over Paris, France.[1] However, the photographs he produced no longer exist and therefore the earliest surviving aerial photograph is titled 'Boston, as the Eagle and the Wild Goose See
It.' Taken by James Wallace Black and Samuel Archer King on October 13, 1860, it depicts Boston from a height of 630m.<br>

      Fashion photography is a genre of photography which is devoted to displaying clothing and other fashion items.
      Fashion photography is most often conducted for advertisements or fashion magazines such as Vogue, Vanity Fair, or Elle.<br>
      Fashion photography has been in existence since the earliest days of photography. In 1856, Adolphe Braun published a book containing 288 photographs of Virginia Oldoini, Countess di Castiglione, a Tuscan noblewoman at the court of Napoleon III. The photos depict her in her official court garb, making her the first fashion model.[1]
      In the first decade of the 20th century, advances in halftone printing allowed fashion photographs to be featured in magazines. Fashion photography made its first appearance in French magazines such as La mode pratique.
